1. The organization admin:  A team of curators, developers, publishers, marketing specialists and coordinators and UX/UI designers.

    As an admin, our team would like to offer a platform for artists, designers, curators and collectors to connect with one another in one space so that they can manage collection easier and build a community to exhibit and support quality artworks and products.


2. Designers/Artists

    As a designer/artist, I would like to reach out to a wider audience and expand opportunities to collaborate with other designers, artists and curators beyond physical spaces.  


3. Collectors

    As a collector, I would like to discover and explore new design projects, artworks and exhibition venues worldwide, buy products or make collections and stay up-to-date with my favourite designers/artists.
